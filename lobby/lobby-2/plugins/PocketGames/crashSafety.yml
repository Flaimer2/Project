# This is a crash safety storage file for player inventories.
# 
# Once a player starts playing a Pocket Game their inventory is stored internally and in this file.
# The player is removed again once they are no longer playing.
# The player's inventory will remain in this file and is not lost should the server unexpectedly crash during play for whatever reason.
# This file is checked when a player joins. If the player is in the file the inventory is returned to the player.
# 
# Do NOT edit this file manually unless you know exactly what you are doing.
