 # This addon allows you to define actions when certain amounts of warns are reached.
 # The warn tally is per-victim, meaning user punishments and IP punishments are tallied separately.
 # 
 # Please note this configuration is unordered, meaning it is acceptable to read
 # auto-commands:
 # - 8: 'command which runs at eight warns'
 # - 2: 'command which runs at two warns'
 # for example.
 # Commands to execute.
 # 
 # Each command is executed by the console. Note that if LibertyBans is installed
 # on the proxy, you will not be able to run commands from plugins on the backend servers;
 # likewise if installed on the backend servers, you will not be able to run proxy commands.
 # 
 # The available variables are the same as those available in punishment messages.
 # Do not use a leading slash unless the command is double-slashed (e.g., //wand in WorldEdit).

 # Punishments to perform.

 # punishment notifications will be broadcast as usual; if false, no notifications are sent.
